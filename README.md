# CMU-CCS-Activities
These are the activities of College of Malabon University (CMU) and my source code for people interested.

You can take these for preparation>:D

Helping those in need are fun, as long as I'll be able to do it in the best of my ability.
Feel free to gatekeep this or share it with a friend, and please message me about your score!

If you are a CMU CCS Officer (Oh noes) wanting this repo to be taken down, please email me at randomemail450sn@gmail.com
