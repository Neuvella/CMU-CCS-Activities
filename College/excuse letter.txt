Dear Sir. Jhuztin Pagad,

I, Vlademir Charles S. Maniaol, a BSIT 1A student of College of Malabon University (CMU), excuse my absence from our online class today at Saturday, July 26, 2025, due to helping my parents clean and wipe our floors after rain water had leaked through our walls. My focus on my parent's order than checking our group chat was regrettable, and I apologize for the inconvenience.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely, 
Vlademir Charles S. Maniaol
